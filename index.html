	<p>In order to loss fat the body has to be in a <b>calorie deficit state</b>. 
	<br/> You don't have to eat only salad, you don't have to avoid any specific food and you don't even have to exercise to acheive that.
	<br/> The most practical way to get into a calorie deficit state is to eat for 3 weeks or a month the same amount of calories each day,
	<br/> After that, weigh yourself/look at the mirror/put an old cloth and see if there is any change. If you lost weight - keep going
	<br/> (eat whatever you want as long as you don't change the overall calorie intake and don't decrease the amount of your current activity)
	<br/> If there is no change try to eat less or (better option) try to change some of your diet to have more low calorie - non dense food.
	<br/> If you gained fat - do the same thing as if there is no change but to a higher degree.	
	</p>
	
	<h2>Cardio </h2>

	<p>The main importance of cardio is to improve the overall health, and not to (only) to loss fat.
	<br/> We know now what we have to do in order to loss fat, we understand that cardio is not a mandatory but a way to help us to loss fat.
	<br/> Incorporate cardio into our life style is very improntant due it's health benefits, 150 minutes of cardio in a week would suffice 
	<br/> and will help you to improve your overall health.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Building strength and muscle </h2>
	<img src = "https://imgcdn.cleanhealth.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/26215127/Strength-VS-Hypertrophy-Mail.jpg" />
	<p> Many think that building strength and muscle are one and the same, but that's not true at all.
	<br/> Desptie having a high correlation, building each requires a different approach - different workouts.
	<br/> The workout of strength building should be foucsing on performing lifts of very heavy weight, with long rest time(2-8 minutes) and 
	<br/> performing exersices like bench press, deadlift and squat (and more compound movment exersices).
	<br/> On the other hand, building muscle will require a lower rest time, lower weight (though still somewhat heavy) and foucsing also on
	<br/> specific muscule groups like the biceps.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Progressive overload </h2>
	<img src ="https://silveredgefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/milo-of-croton.jpg"/>
	<p> In order to change our bodies physically - make it able to run longer, jump higher, get stronger, etc.
	<br/> We have to gradually increase the stimulation of our muscles and our body, this is progressive overload.
	<br/> So how do we do that? Our body is "smart" so it won't change anything unless it's needed, that's mean we have to "convince"
	<br/> that the change that we want is important, we do so by taking our body to it's limits (though it's not necessary at all for
	<br/> beginners). Let's see an exapmle: a person can bench a certain amount of weight for a certain amount of repitions - if he/she
	<br/> will add slighlty more weight/repitions/sets/etc he will be able to get stronger in time to an uppper limit of course.
